%% This function computes all the metrics of the CAP analysis framework
% Inputs:
%
% - idx depicts the indices of the frames that have been clustered (the
% cluster to which they belong)
% - xindp1 depicts the indices of the frames that have been selected as
% activation moments
% - xindn1 is the same for deactivation time points
% - sind depicts scrubbed frames
% - n_clusters is the number of clusters used for state disentanglement
% - TR is the TR of the experiment
% - CAPType denotes the type of clustering that has been chosen (only
% activation, only deactivation, or both)
% 
% Outputs:
% 
% - TPM (n_subjects x n_frames) is the state sequence matrix
% - Counts (-> raw/frac -> scrubbed/baseline/state: n_subj x n_states)
% contains the counts (raw and normalized)
% - Number (n_subj x n_seqtype) with sequence type: scrub, act/deact/-,
% baseline, then states
% - Avg_Duration (n_subj x n_seqtype) contains the average duration of a
% state for a subject
% - Duration (n_subj array of size 1 x n_sequences) contains the duration
% of the state sequences for each subject
% - TM (n_seqtype x n_seqtype) encompasses the transitions that exist
